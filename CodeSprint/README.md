### CompetitiveProgrammingSnippet

A lightweight C++ template designed for competitive programming.  
It includes fast input/output, common headers, type shortcuts, and utility macros to speed up problem solving during contests.

---

#### Features
1. **Pre‑included headers** – Standard libraries for math, strings, containers, and algorithms.
2. **Type shortcuts** – `ll` for `long long`, `vi` for `vector<int>`, `vl` for `vector<long long>`.
3. **Fast I/O macro** – `fast_io()` sets up faster input/output streams.
4. **Utility macros** – Common operations like `pb`, `sort_all`, `reverse_all`, `sz(x)`, and precision formatting.
5. **Template structure** – `solve()` function for problem logic, `main()` with test case loop.
